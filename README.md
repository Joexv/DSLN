## Introduction

This repository will house alll the assembly source code, as well as the source for any related tools that might arise during the making of this project. The aim of this project is to provide a framework for Emerald hackers similar to that of JPAN's Hacked Engine for FireRed. As such, there will be many similarities: this project aims to provide all what JPAN's engine does, and more.

## Installation

You can use the assemble.py script found in each sub-directory to install the sub-project it belongs to. Right now, you have to manually modify the space used for each hack, but that will change in the future.
