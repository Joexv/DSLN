## Introduction

This document will describe both planned and implemented features for this engine.

## Tag Team Battles

Although present in Emerald (with the Space Centre battle in Mossdeep City with Steven Stone), it was very limited. This engine aims to make this style of battle more like the ones found in the fourth generation games.

## Expanded Overworlds

Like JPAN's engine, this engine provides space for more overworlds. It functions similarly to JPAN's hack, as it uses an unused byte in the person data to specify which bank is used. Palettes are just a matter of expanding the existing table.

## Multi Battles

Emerald introduced mutli battles: multiple opponents vs. the player. This engine will allow these battles to be started from a script. They will work with Tag Teams.

## Backsprites

More backsprites will be provided for Tag Team partners, as well as a way to switch the player's backsprite for any changes to his or her apparel.

## Run-time trainer modificaton

Similar to JPAN's engine, this will provide a way to edit the player's overworld and trainer sprite at run-time.
